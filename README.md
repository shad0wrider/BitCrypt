This is **BitCrypt** , A program that can efficiently and securely encrypt your files 

Even Supports files as big as  1 - 5 gb 


**Features**:

1. Uses military grade , unbreakable and quantam-proof aes-256 encryption algorithm.
2. Uses GCM mode which is a modern stream cipher with built in layer 1 data integrity.
3. Has HMAC for 2 layers of un-breakable data integrity.
4. Password Checking without using the actual digest of the Password.
5. Uses custom Saltyv2 + Argon2id for secure master key generation.
6. Optimized for Big and Small files alike.

**Why This Matters**

Before uploading sensitive files to cloud storage services like Google Drive, it's crucial to encrypt them on your device using tools like BitCrypt. While cloud services offer a degree of security, uploading unencrypted files exposes you to multiple risks, including data breaches, unauthorized access, or even internal security threats.

Additionally, many cloud providers may use your data for purposes like training AI models or improving their services. This means your personal or sensitive information could be processed and analyzed without your explicit consent. By encrypting your files before uploading, you ensure that your data stays private and is only accessible by you or those with the password you enter in BitCrypt.

This Tool provides an easy way to encrypt files locally, so you can securely upload to the cloud without worrying about privacy compromises.
